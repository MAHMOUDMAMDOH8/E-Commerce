# E-Commerce
The E-Commerce project aims to design and implement a comprehensive data solution using SQL Server, SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), and Power BI. The project involves creating a Data Warehouse (DW) and leveraging Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

Key Components
SQL Server: The project utilizes SQL Server as the database management system for storing and managing large volumes of data efficiently.

SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services): SSIS is used for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources into the Data Warehouse.

Data Warehouse (DW): A unified and optimized repository of data designed to support efficient querying and reporting. It follows a dimensional modeling approach (e.g., star or snowflake schema).

Power BI: Power BI is employed for data visualization, interactive dashboards, and reporting, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights from the Data Warehouse.
